A git repository created and named "Alx_DjangoLearnLab".
Inside it there is a directory named "Introduction_to_Django".
After creating Introduction_to_Django directory, I have django installed already on my system "pip install django" not need again.


So I run my command "django-admin startproject LibraryProject" to create my LibraryProject. I wonder why djago created the project and then go ahead and create directory with the same name, inside it I saw asgi.py, settings.py, urls.py, wsgi.py, and others.

After created the project, I navigate to into LibraryProject and created README.md file and I run my server with "python manage.py runserver"

This is an amazing experience, the page now shows me "The install worked successfully! Congratulations!"
